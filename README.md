# Project Description:
A web-based interactive project that visually simulates process scheduling algorithms in operating systems,
including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin (RR). 
The project aims to demonstrate how these algorithms function through dynamic animations that depict the processing of tasks according to each scheduling method.

The platform features a user-friendly interface where users can input process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority (if applicable).
Once the data is provided, the project simulates the algorithms and displays the results visually, 
helping students and enthusiasts understand the key differences between these scheduling techniques in an engaging and simplified manner.

This project serves as a powerful educational tool to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical visualization of scheduling algorithms.
